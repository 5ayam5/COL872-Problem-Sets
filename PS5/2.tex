\begin{solution}{Question 2}\label{ques:2}
    \begin{question}
    Let $(Setup, H)$ be an SSB-hash. Construct a collapsing hash function (with appropriate domain and co-domain) using the SSB-hash, and prove security of your construction.
    \end{question}
    \tcblower{}
    \begin{proof}
    Let $H_k$ be an SSB-hash with input domain $(\{0,1\}^s)^L$ and co-domain be $\{0,1\}^l$ with hash key $k$. The same construction of $H_k$ works as a collapsing hash. The property of $H_k$ is that $\prob{\exists x = (x[0], x[1], \ldots x[L-1])}$
    \end{proof}
\end{solution}
