\begin{solution}{Optimal Attack on Wiesnerâ€™s Scheme}\label{ques:x}
    \begin{question}
    Give a procedure that succeeds in attacking Weisner's Scheme with probability at least $\frac{5}{8}$ 
    \end{question}

    \begin{proof}
    The Procedure is as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Bank sends a qubit $\ket{\psi}$ to adversary.
        \item Adversary measures the qubit in $\{\ket{0},\ket{1}\}$ basis.
        \item Adversary creates two identical copies based on the measured value and sends the qubits to the Bank.
    \end{enumerate}

    If the qubit is in $\{\ket{0},\ket{1}\}$ basis, we will get the correct measurement and will be able to model copies correctly and fool the bank.

    If the qubit is in $\{\ket{+},\ket{-}\}$ basis, The adversary measures in $\{\ket{0},\ket{1}\}$ basis and models the qubit in the same basis. When the bank measures the copies in $\{\ket{+},\ket{-}\}$ basis, there is a 1/2 probability of getting the correct measurement for each copy.

    Therefore, the overall probability of fooling the Bank is $\frac{1}{2} \times 1 + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{8}$
    
    \end{proof}
