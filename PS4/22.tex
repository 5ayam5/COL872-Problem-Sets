\begin{solution}{Question 2: Collapsing hash from claw-free functions}\label{ques:x}
    \begin{question}
    Construct a hash function family $ \calH' = \{\calH'_k : \{0,1\}^{n+2} \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n \} $ using $\calF$, and prove that $\calH'$ is collapsing, assuming $\calF$ is a claw-free function family.

    \end{question}
    \tcblower{}
    \begin{proof}
    We can define the hash function family $\calH'$ as 
    \[\calH' = \{\calH'_k : \calH'_k \equiv f_k(x,(f_k(y,z))), x,y \in \{0,1\}, z \in \{0,1\}^n \}\]

    We have to show the collapsing property, We will show this via Hybrids:\newline

    In all the Worlds, Adversary sends $\psi = \sum\limits_{\substack{x,y,z\\ f_k(x,f_k(y,z)) = h}} \ket{x,y,z}$.
    
    \textbf{\underline{World-0:}}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Adversary gets back $\psi$ from the challenger.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{\underline{Hybrid-0:}}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Adversary gets back $\psi$ measured at $x=x'$ from the challenger, \newline $\psi =\sum\limits_{\substack{y,z\\ f_k(x',f_k(y,z)) = h}} \ket{x',y,z}$.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{\underline{Hybrid-1:}}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Adversary gets back $\psi$ measured at $x=x',y=y'$ from the challenger, \newline $\psi =\sum\limits_{\substack{z\\ f_k(x',f_k(y',z)) = h}} \ket{x',y',z}$.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{\underline{World-1:}}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Adversary gets back $\psi$ measured at $x=x',y=y', z=z'$ from the challenger, \newline $\psi = \ket{x',y',z'}; f_k(x',f_k(y',z')) = h$.
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{claim}
    World-0 and Hybrid-0 are Computationally indistinguishable.
    \end{claim}
    \begin{proof}
        Let us assume The worlds are far apart, If an adversary can distinguish, from this we can have a reduction that breaks the collapsing property of $f_k$.

        Reduction:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Challenger sends key k to reduction B which is passed on to Adversary A.
            \item A sends state $\psi = \sum\limits_{\substack{x,y,z\\ f_k(x,f_k(y,z)) = h}} \ket{x,y,z}$ to B.
            \item B applies $f_k$ to get $\sum\limits_{\substack{x,y,z\\ f_k(x,f_k(y,z)) = h}}\ket{x,y,z}\ket{f_k(y,z)}$ and sends first part of  $\sum\limits_{\substack{x,y,z\\ f_k(x,f_k(y,z)) = h}}\ket{x}\ket{f_k(y,z)}\otimes\ket{y,z}$ to Challenger C.
            \item C chooses bit b and accordingly sends $\ket{\varphi}$ to B.
            \item B un-entangles register containing result of $f_k$ application and sends the x,y,z registers to A where x can be measured or not depending upon bit b.
            \item A sends it's guess b' to B who passes the same to C.
        \end{enumerate}

        Now in the case when b=0, the reduction acts like World-0 and when b=1, behaves like Hybrid-0. Now if A is able to win with non-negligible probability then B can also win with a non-negligible probability.

    \end{proof}
    \begin{claim}
    Hybrid-0 and Hybrid-1 are Computationally indistinguishable.
    \end{claim}
    \begin{proof}
        Let us assume The worlds are far apart, If an adversary can distinguish, from this we can have a reduction that breaks the collapsing property of $f_k$.

        Reduction:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Challenger sends key k to reduction B which is passed on to Adversary A.
            \item A sends state $\psi = \sum\limits_{\substack{x,y,z\\ f_k(x,f_k(y,z)) = h}} \ket{x,y,z}$ to B.
            \item B measures register x to get $x=x'$ and sends  $\sum\limits_{\substack{y,z\\ f_k(x',f_k(y,z)) = h}}\ket{y,z}$ to Challenger C.
            \item C chooses bit b and accordingly sends $\ket{\varphi}$ to B.
            \item B sends the x,y,z registers to A where $x=x'$ and y can be measured or not depending upon bit b.
            \item A sends it's guess b' to B who passes the same to C.
        \end{enumerate}

        Now in the case when b=0, the reduction acts like Hybrid-0 and when b=1, behaves like Hybrid-1. Now if A is able to win with non-negligible probability then B can also win with a non-negligible probability.

    \end{proof}

    \begin{claim}
    Hybrid-1 and World-1 are Computationally indistinguishable.
    \end{claim}

    \begin{proof}
        In both the worlds, we have measured the first 2 bits x and y. According to the definition of claw-free function, For a fixed starting bit, the function acts like a injection and therefore the superposition will contain a single element and the $\psi$ will be identical for both the worlds which is indistinguishable as identical qubits are indistinguishable.
    \end{proof}

    Fro the above three claims we can say that the words World-0 and World-1 are Computationally indistinguishable. From this we can infer the fact that $\calH'$ is collapsing.
    \end{proof}
