\begin{solution}{Question 2: A Lossy Encryption Scheme based on LWE}\label{ques:2}
    \begin{question}
    In this problem, you will have to construct a lossy encryption mode for Regev
encryption. The algorithms $\setup, \enc, \dec$ are defined as in class (see Lecture Notes).
You must define the $\lsetup$ algorithm, and then show that it is a secure lossy
encryption scheme.
