\begin{solution}{Question 3.3: Small Secrets LWE - Matrix Version}\label{ques:33}
    \begin{question}
    Recall, in the Learning-with-errors problem, if $m = n$, then the two distributions are statistically indistinguishable. Does the same hold true in the small- secrets setting?
    \end{question}

    \begin{proof}
    As Small Secrets LWE and normal LWE are equivalent to each other,if $m=n$, the small secrets LWE will maintain statistical indistinguishability. Otherwise as there is a polynomial time reduction from $\sslwe$ to $\lwe$, then if $\sslwe$ is distinguishable, then it can be reduced to a $\lwe$ which will also be distinguishable, which contradicts the established fact that $\lwe$ is statistically indistinguishable, if $m=n$. Additionally, no new information can be obtained by an unbounded adversary from the solution of $s^TA = x$, where $(A, x)$ was the tuple received.
    \end{proof}
