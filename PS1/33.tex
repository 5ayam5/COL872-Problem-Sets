\begin{solution}{Question 3.3: Small Secrets LWE - Matrix Version}\label{ques:33}
    \begin{question}
    Recall, in the Learning-with-errors problem, if $m = n$, then the two distributions are statistically indistinguishable. Does the same hold true in the small- secrets setting?
    \end{question}
    \tcblower{}
    \begin{proof}
    
        When we calculate the randomness of both the distributions, for $\calD_2$, randomness is $(nm+nm)\log q$, and for $\calD_1$, the randomness comes out to be $nm \log q + (n^2 +nm)\log B$ where $B$ depends on the range of $\chi$. If the range of $\chi$ is less than $\sqrt{q}$, then both the distributions have different randomness and thus are statistically far-apart. So, in general, nothing conclusive can be said about statistical indistinguishability of Small Secrets LWE - Matrix Version as the indistinguishability can change depending upon the range of $\chi$.
    \end{proof}
