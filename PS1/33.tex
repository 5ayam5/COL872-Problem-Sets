\begin{solution}{Question 3.3: Small Secrets LWE - Matrix Version}\label{ques:33}
    \begin{question}
    Recall, in the Learning-with-errors problem, if $m = n$, then the two distributions are statistically indistinguishable. Does the same hold true in the small- secrets setting?
    \end{question}

    \begin{proof}
        As Small Secrets LWE and normal LWE are equivalent to each other,if $m=n$, the small secrets LWE will maintain statistical indistinguishability. Additionally, no new information can be obtained by an unbounded adversary from the solution of $x^TA = y$, where $(A, y)$ was the tuple received since $x$ either corresponds to $bA^{-1}$ or $s^T+eA^{-1}$ which are both completely random.
    \end{proof}
\end{solution}
