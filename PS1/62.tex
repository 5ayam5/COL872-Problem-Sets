\begin{solution}{Question 6.1: Code Obfuscation}\label{ques:61}
    \begin{question}
        Propose an attempt at obfuscation of $f_z$ using matrices and ideas developed in Question~\ref{ques:5}. Describe $\obf$ and $\eval$. Show that your scheme satisfies correctness. Prove security of your scheme, assuming $\sslwe$. Note that $t$ must be large for this proof to work. How large must $t$ be?
