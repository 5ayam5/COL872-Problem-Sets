\begin{solution}{Question 3.1}\label{ques:31}
    \begin{question}
    Construct a single qubit quantum circuit such that it has identical output on $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$, but different output on $\ket{+}$.

    \end{question}

    \begin{proof}

    Currently we do not know any unitary which gives same output on $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$, so to achieve the objective, we will need to apply measurement. So we can create a circuit like 
    \begin{center}
    \begin{quantikz}
    \qw & \gate{H} &\qw& \meter{}& \qw
    \end{quantikz}
    \end{center}
Now, when we put $\ket{0}$ as input, we get $\ket{+}$ from the Hadamard and we get $\ket{-}$ on inputting $\ket{1}$. As both of them have the same density matrix, we will get the same measurement from both of them.

While if we input $\ket{+}$ in the circuit, Hadamard gives us $\ket{0}$ as output which has a different density matrix from $\ket{+}$ and $\ket{-}$ and thus will give different measurement.

In this way we get the required circuit.
    
    \end{proof}
\end{solution}
