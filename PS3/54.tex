\begin{solution}{Question 5.4}\label{ques:5.4}
    \begin{question}
    The above encryption scheme can be extended to encrypt any $m$ qubit state using $2m$ classical bits. Propose a public key encryption scheme that can encrypt any quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ (over $m$ qubits, where $m$ is unbounded). As in the classical setting, we will have only computational security, and the security depends on the key length. You donâ€™t need to prove security here.
